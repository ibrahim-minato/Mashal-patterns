"Add professional curve drawing and editing tools specifically for sewing pattern work:
FRENCH CURVE LIBRARY:

Hip curve (pattern master curve)
Armhole curve (front & back templates)
Neckline curves (variety of depths)
Sleeve cap curves (standard ease distributions)
Crotch curve (pants front & back)
Collar curves (neck edge, outer edge)
Princess seam curves
Side seam curves
Hem curves (A-line, circle skirt)
Waistband curves

CURVE DRAWING TOOLS:

Bezier curve tool with adjustable control handles
Smooth freehand curve with auto-smoothing
Point-to-point curve (click nodes, auto-smooth between)
Curve through points (draws best-fit curve through selected points)
Fair curve tool (automatically creates smooth, even curves)
Spiral curve for design elements

CURVE EDITING:

Node editing:

Add/delete nodes on curve
Convert to corner, smooth, or symmetric nodes
Adjust tangent handles independently
Auto-smooth selected sections


Curve manipulation:

Push/pull curve segments
Offset curve (parallel curves for seam allowances)
Reverse curve direction
Extend curve endpoints
Join curves smoothly
Break curve at node


Curve refinement:

Simplify curve (reduce nodes while keeping shape)
Add curvature (increase/decrease curve depth)
Straighten sections
Match curve to template
Blend between two curves



PATTERN-SPECIFIC CURVE TOOLS:

Sleeve Cap Generator:

Input: armhole measurement, sleeve width, cap height
Auto-generates properly shaped sleeve cap curve
Adjustable ease distribution (front vs back)
Cap height adjuster


Armhole Curve Tool:

Auto-fit to shoulder and side seam points
Front vs back curve templates
Depth and width adjusters
Ensure proper pitch/angle


Neckline Curve Tool:

Depth and width sliders
Style presets (jewel, scoop, V-neck, sweetheart, square)
Front vs back drop adjustments
Shoulder slope integration


Crotch Curve Tool:

Front vs back curve shapes
Rise adjustment (low, mid, high)
Inseam-to-outseam smooth transition
Sit curve depth control


Princess Seam Curve Tool:

Dart-to-seam conversion
Automatic matching front/side panel curves
Waist suppression distribution
Bust point alignment



CURVE MATCHING & WALKING:

Walk seam tool: Check if two curves are same length
Measure curve length (actual vs straight-line distance)
Match curve lengths: Auto-adjust to make seams equal
Notch placement: Auto-place matching notches on paired curves
Curve alignment guides: Visual overlay to compare curves
Seam ease calculator: Show difference between joined curves
