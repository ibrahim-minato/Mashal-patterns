"Create a professional vector drawing application with an advanced workspace modeled after Inkscape, including:
MAIN WORKSPACE LAYOUT:

Large central canvas with infinite zoom and pan
Customizable dark/light theme
Rulers on top and left edges with adjustable units (px, mm, in, pt)
Draggable guidelines from rulers
Status bar showing coordinates, zoom level, object info
Multiple document tabs

ADVANCED TOOLBOX (Left Sidebar):

Selection tool (move, scale, rotate, skew)
Node editing tool (Bezier paths with handles)
Tweak tool (sculpt/push/pull paths)
Spray tool (scatter clones)
Calligraphy/brush tool with pressure sensitivity
Shape tools (rectangle, circle, polygon, star, spiral)
3D box tool (perspective drawing)
Bezier/pen tool (draw custom paths)
Pencil tool (freehand)
Text tool with full typography controls
Gradient tool (linear, radial)
Eyedropper/color picker
Paint bucket (fill bounded areas)
Eraser with vector subtraction

TOP TOOLBAR (Context-Sensitive):

Changes based on selected tool
Numerical input boxes for precise values
Stroke width, style, caps, joins
Fill and stroke selectors
Opacity controls
Blend modes (multiply, screen, overlay, etc.)

RIGHT PANEL (Collapsible Sections):

Fill & Stroke panel: Flat color, gradients, patterns, none
Layers panel: Show/hide, lock, reorder, group management
Align & Distribute: Alignment to page, selection, grid
Transform panel: Precise position, size, rotation, skew inputs
Text & Font: Font family, size, spacing, alignment
Path Effects (Live): Bend, pattern along path, envelope deformation, rough edges
Filters: Blur, drop shadow, glow, bevel, artistic effects
Objects panel: Tree view of all elements
Symbols library: Drag-and-drop reusable elements

ADVANCED PATTERN FEATURES:

Tiled Clones dialog: Full Inkscape P1-P6 symmetry groups with:

Shift (per row/column with %)
Scale (progressive sizing)
Rotation (per row/column in degrees)
Color/opacity shifts with HSL controls
Randomization sliders for all parameters
Exclude tiles checkbox pattern
Remove overlaps option
Live preview with apply/reset buttons


Pattern creator: Convert any selection to reusable pattern fill
Pattern editor: Edit patterns in isolated mode
Spray clone settings: Size, amount, rotation, scale variation
Interpolate function: Create in-between steps between two objects

SYMMETRY & LIVE PATH EFFECTS:

Real-time mirror symmetry (1-16 axes)
Rotational symmetry (2-32 copies)
Envelope/mesh deform
Bend path
Pattern along path
Rough/hand-drawn effect
Hatches (crosshatch fills)
Measure lines
Construct grid
Lattice deformation

PATH OPERATIONS:

Union, Difference, Intersection, Exclusion, Division
Inset/Outset paths
Dynamic offset (live)
Simplify path
Reverse path direction
Break apart/combine
Path to object/stroke to path

ADVANCED FEATURES:

Snap controls: Detailed snap toolbar with options for:

Grid snap (adjustable spacing)
Guide snap
Object snap (nodes, paths, centers, edges)
Page border snap
Rotation snap (15°, 30°, 45° increments)


Grid options:

Rectangular, axonometric, isometric
Custom spacing and angles
Major/minor grid lines
Multiple grids simultaneously


Extensions menu: Scriptable operations
Bezier tool modes: Straight lines, curves, multiple node types (corner, smooth, symmetric, auto-smooth)
Clipping & masking: Vector masks with editing
Boolean operations: Non-destructive compound paths
Trace bitmap: Convert raster to vector

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:

Full customizable shortcut system
Quick access: G (gradient), D (duplicate), Ctrl+D (clone), Ctrl+G (group)
Number keys for zoom presets
Tab to cycle through objects

EXPORT OPTIONS:

SVG (native format)
PNG with DPI settings
PDF, EPS export
Batch export multiple objects
Export selection only

PERFORMANCE:

Hardware acceleration for smooth zooming
Outline/preview mode toggle
Gaussian blur quality settings
Undo/redo with history slider (50+ steps)

Make the interface fully responsive, with collapsible panels and customizable workspace layouts that can be saved as presets."
